      "profileDesc": "Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, insecurity, fear, existential issues living in a world full of demands, these are all topics that each of us can face in life sometimes and that's why I'm here to help you. Welcome to my profile! I'm an experienced integrative-holistic counsellor, and my professional path begins 23 years ago. Since then, I've been involved in the field of private education as a foreign language coach, didactic supervisor and school counsellor. I’ve also collaborated with TV channels promoting the importance of Art Therapy, as well as published different articles focused on counselling. I'm based in Italy and due to my origins I often do voluntary work for the Greek/Italian Community in my city. Except of my Master's degree in clinical psychology, my HND in counselling and other professional qualifications, as proof of my love for art, I also hold a Bachelor's degree in drama techniques, and for a few years now I've been also leading a workshop of dramatic experimentation based on the psycho-cathartic qualities of classic Greek theatre (Comedy and Tragedy). Nevertheless, these few last years I decided to give my life a serious twist and focus more on online counselling, convinced that the future of therapy lies in the digital world, and therefore I focused more on individual therapy, gaining more experience as an EAP therapist.In my sessions I use different tools, methods and techniques according to the case of each consultant. Behind psychological discomfort can be a thousand blockages, not only emotional but also somatic, energetic, and sometimes spiritual, that's why I see and treat every individual in terms of mind, body and spirit as a unique whole. I firmly believe that the most important keys to wellness are willingness and an authentic therapeutic relationship, so as a therapist I think that I'm characterized by honesty, empathy and a strong sense of helping others. I'm a Register BACP Member, an IPHM accredited Mindfulness Educator, a certified Bioenergetic Analyst, a Trainer Counsellor registered with the holistic counselling centre of Rome Erba Sacra and a full accredited Acting Coach.",

I'm a Graduate Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist, working in Brighton and Hove. I have past experience in mental health, general practice and domestic abuse settings. I don't diagnose you or tell you what to do. Instead I support you in a non-judgemental and empathic way, offering psychologically informed reflections. I have a National Open College Network Counselling Skills Certificate, (2010) and a BA (Hons) Counselling Studies Degree, (2013). I'm an Accredited Registrant member of The National Counselling Society. My training included a range of approaches including: Humanistic, CBT, Psychodynamic, Gestalt, TA and Person-centred. This means that I can tailor my way of working around whatever it is you need to bring. I have a collaborative therapeutic style. We can work through your past whilst also looking at the present. Some helpful interventions can be providing healthy coping mechanisms, positive reframing and managing aims, goals and future expectations. I place equal value on the provision of a safe and understanding space, where you will be both seen and heard. Post qualification courses include focusing on: child sexual abuse, emotional abuse, recovering from narcissistic abuse, domestic violence and trauma, self-worth, intrusive thoughts and Imposter Syndrome. Some issues regularly raised in practice are: depression, anxiety, grief and loss, trauma, abuse and difficulties with relationships. This list is not exhaustive and anything that is causing you distress is worthy of attention, so please don't hesitate to get in touch.",

Background Insight: So, with the clients I've had the distinct honour of working with across the past 8 years, via Harley and beyond, I would happily make the following observations: Therapy does indeed produce results, but it is a very collaborative effort/project and it requires the following key values within each patient/client, these being: As a therapist, out jobs are two fold, 1) To support our patients/clients with their problems and 2) To support them in developing their own problem solving mechanisms/ability for life (i.e. to develop your own powers ;+) as it were) with No 2, being vastly more important than No 1 - Professor Jordan B Peterson.",

It can give you new understanding, new insights, a different perspective, clarity about a problem and the way forward. It can teach you skills to live your life better, teach you more healthy coping strategies or simply give you the space and time for self reflection and a place to find peace of mind. Our brains are unique to us. Just like our fingerprints and how we experience and make sense of the world is entirely subjective. This is why two people can experience similar events and have remarkably different reactions. It also explains how our reactions to similar events can change.",

Enforced isolation could be causing many kinds of mental distress and making existing challenges or conditions more difficult to handle. During this period I am offering phone and online counselling. We can use your preferred software (Zoom, WhatsApp Video, Face time or Skype) and if you are uncomfortable with technology I can spend some time helping you get set up, maybe starting with a phone session. Enforced isolation could be worsening pre existing conditions and symptoms such as depression, loneliness and anxiety. Maybe your phobias and obsessive habits have become stronger. If you have already been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder maybe you cannot handle any more stress. Some relationships may come under pressure when spending 24 hours a day together.",
